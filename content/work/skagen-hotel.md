I was approached by Norwegian ad-agency, Bedre.no to create a new look for one of their clients, a local hotel group.

The design needed to optimised for mobile and performance and was to include the home page and inner page layout.

The wireframes and finished design were created in Adobe Fireworks, prior to it's fall from grace.

While I was not involved in the implementation, the site was built using Joomla! CMS.
