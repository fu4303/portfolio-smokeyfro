I was approached by Ezette Poole, who has been providing tailored tours around the world for over two decades and brings a wealth of experience to her clients, to build her a new site to showcase the tours she offers.

After the a initial brief, I set to work on creating a custom theme and site plugin. Being that Ezette is a self-proclaimed techno-phobe, my goal for the finished site would be that it's super easy for her to maintain. I achieved this by creating custom post types for the tours along with a taxonomy for countries and further customised the WordPress admin to only see what was absolutely relevant to her completing any given task.

**Here is a summery of some of the admin tweaks:**

- Replaced the WordPress logo on the login page with her own.
- Setup a shortcut /login redirect to the WordPress login page.
- Redirect to the Tours admin list on login.
- Removed unecessary menu items, list filters, dashboard widgets and post meta.

To speed things up I used Contact Form 7 to create the contact form and tour booking enquiry form, which automatically includes the tour you are interested in.
