I had the privelage to work with Madeline Puckette and the WineFolly team for a year and a half. In that time I rebuilt the site from the ground up using Beans (the WordPress theme framework I helped create). 

The site was built using Googles Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project, which aims to set a new standard for the performance of websites on mobile devices. AMP came with it's own set of challenges, most of which being that it's still a relatively new technology, so there isn't that much info out there when you get stuck, or you come across a bug in one of the core components.

Some of the other projects I worked on include:

- A suite of Gutenberg blocks.
- An index of 260+ grape and wine landing pages.
- AB Testing using Google Optimise
- Custom shortcodes, including a super flexible card shortcode.
- A custom shortcode preset builder.
- Native integration with Klaviyo.
- Feedback system for posts.
- Custom post type for team and contributors.
- Custom landing pages for different initiatives.
- Custom API endpoints for the AMP integration.
