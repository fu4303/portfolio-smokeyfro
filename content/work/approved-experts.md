Approved Experts was a service that aimed to simplify the process of finding experts in a particular area of the UK.

Given a few details of what you're looking for, the system would list the available experts with the appropriate skills. If no experts meet the clients needs, the support team would find experts in the clients area based on the criteria given.

I was hired to design the marketing site and the web app, which included the initial onboarding process.
